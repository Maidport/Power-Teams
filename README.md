# Power-Teams

## Problem
- This is an interdepartmental content management system I design for my church.
We have an issue were various departments have content they want to to flag during the sermon.
This means that we battle constantly with multiple people coming in and out of our workspace with request as small as a flier for an annoouncement or a submittion of lyrics
for a new song the choir will be singing.

## Description:
- This system is designed to allow mutliple departments to manage their content and make it accessible to the main department, (Technical Department).
The choir can add lyric to their library and we will have acces to them immediatly.
The pastorial team can upload their notes for reference scriptures and will have access to the immediatly.
The MC team can upload the annoucements for the day and we will have access to the immediatly.
An issue tracker is also added to the system which allows departments to flag issues and have them known by everyone.
